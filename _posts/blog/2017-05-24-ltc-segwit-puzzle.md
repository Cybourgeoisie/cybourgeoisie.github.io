![alt text](/images/ltcsteg.jpeg "Litecoin Segwit Puzzle by Zd3n.")

For two weeks in May 2017, I worked with a team of talented people (aliases: Gerschel, Jrhedman, Mys, Tako, Anagamidev) to solve a steganographic puzzle released by Litecoin's creator, [Charlie Lee](https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite), and designed by [Zd3n](http://zd3n.com), mad scientist cryptoartist. The puzzle was initially posted on [Zd3n's crypto puzzle site](http://crypto.haluska.sk).

After 13 days of hyper intense focus, we found the answer, which is posted here: [LTCStegCode](https://github.com/Cybourgeoisie/LTCStegCode).

Mys [wrote a story](https://steemit.com/litecoin/@mys/remember-this-210-ltc-worth-puzzle-posted-by-charlie-lee-we-have-solved-it-detail-explanation-inside-how-we-did-that) about the journey to find the answer.

Since solving this puzzle, I've been closely following the puzzles created by [Zd3n](https://twitter.com/Zd3N), [coin_artist](https://twitter.com/coin_artist), and other members of the cypherpunk art scene.
