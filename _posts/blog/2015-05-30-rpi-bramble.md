Received the materials to start experimenting with a Raspberry Pi bramble earlier this week:

- Two Raspberry Pi 2 B+
- Several ethernet cables
- Two 8 GB SD cards (supposed to have NOOBS pre-installed.. both were corrupt)
- Two power supplies (5V 2000mA)
- Verizon router (4 connections, from Goodwill)
- Logitech keyboard and mouse, wired

Just installed Raspbian. Going to try to install MPICH2 shortly and see if I can get the two Pis to chat.
