I'll fill this out in more detail later. We're not in a hurry, are we?

My name is Ben, and I do computers. I program for a hobby and attend grad school for computer science. I'm also interested in writing, physics, astronomy, photography, karate, music, and playing bass guitar.

My artsy crap can be found at [WakingDream.Space](http://wakingdream.space).
